Total net size of the data: 70 TB. Because of sensitive data compliance points (PII, PCI), data privacy and security was one of the main topics during the design of the Data Lake architecture. Important characteristic of this engagement was to enable Big Data capability build-up at client’s own data scientists team. The Data Lake based on KAVE served as a Data Science platform and is now part of the production solution providing end user dashboards and customizable analytics-as-a-service to its customers. Relevant techniques used are Hadoop, Hive and Spark.\\nStaffed consultant on a project in cooperation with KPMG in Spain for a national banking institution on a number of business case data science pilots ranging from customer segmentation to credit risk. Data used was client transaction data (payments data, credit card data), and static data (consumer credit data), combined dataset size >300GB. The platform used was KPMG’s HADOOP based big data platform KAVE and relevant techniques used were HDFS API, Pandas, Ipython, Jupyter, Machine Learning, dashboarding. \\nBig Data architect at an innovative agricultural company, building a scalable big data acquisition platform, for collecting and analyzing sensor data from cow ear tags for optimization of herd fertility, health and nutrition.
